      "On 6th March 2022, at 10:30 AM, destiny made its move. While playing truth or dare, Puchu (Aditya) finally gathered the courage. He leaned close to her ear and whispered softly — \"I love you.\"",
      "Her friends pushed her too—and she whispered the same back. Two simple sentences began a forever journey.",
      "We met in Class 8, became close friends in Class 9, and became partners in Class 10. School life, studies, laughter, all slowly tied our hearts together.",
      "After Class 10 boards, we studied Class 11–12 (Science) together at Bishalgarh English Medium HS School. We completed Class 12 Boards in 2024, and still stayed close even as life moved forward."
